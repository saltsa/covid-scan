# Covid BLE scanner written in Go

## Compile

```sh
./build.sh
```

This should compile correctly in macOS (with Go 1.15). Build outputs two binary files:
`covid-linux` and `covid-mac`, the first one meant to be run with Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+.
Second one should run on macOS (tested with Big Sur and Catalina). Root privileges might be
needed.
